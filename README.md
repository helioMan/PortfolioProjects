Data Analysis Project: Data Exploration using SQL
#Introduction
This project is a data analysis project that uses SQL to gain insights and perform data exploration. The project was completed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to work with large datasets, create optimized SQL queries, and perform complex data analysis.


#Technologies Used
This project was completed using the following technologies:
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio


#Project Structure
The repository includes the following files and directories:
dataset/ - This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
queries/ - This directory contains the SQL queries used to extract, transform, and analyze the data.
data_exploration/ - This directory contains any scripts or reports generated from the analysis of the data.
README.md - This file.


#Getting Started
To run the project, you will need access to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or a similar database management tool. To set up the project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new database in SQL Server Management Studio.
Import the dataset located in the dataset/ directory into the database.
Open the queries/ directory and execute the queries in the order they are numbered. These queries will extract and transform the data, as well as perform any necessary data cleaning.
Once the data has been extracted and transformed, execute the analysis scripts located in the data_exploration/ directory.


#Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, create optimized SQL queries, and perform complex data analysis. If you have any questions or comments about the project, feel free to contact me at aadisingh964@gmail.com. Thank you for your interest in my work!
